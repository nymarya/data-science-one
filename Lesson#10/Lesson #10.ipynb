For example, if we wanted to find a three character substring in a column that starts with a number between 1 and 6 and ends with two letters of any kind, we could use the following syntax:\n","\n","```python\n","pattern = r\"[1-6][a-z][a-z]\"\n","```\n","\n","If we have a pattern that repeats, we can also use curly brackets { and } to indicate the number of times it repeats:\n","\n","```python\n","pattern = r\"[1-6][a-z][a-z]\" = r\"[1-6][a-z]{2}\"\n","```\n","\n","Let's use what we've learned to explore the [Series.str.extract()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.str.extract.html) method.\n","\n","**Exercise**\n","\n","<left><img width=\"100\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1E8tR7B9YYUXsU_rddJAyq0FrM0MSelxZ\"></left>\n","\n","- Create a regular expression that will match years and assign it to the variable **pattern**.
