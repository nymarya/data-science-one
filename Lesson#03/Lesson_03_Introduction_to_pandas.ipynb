The **DataFrame.tail()** method accepts an optional integer parameter to specify the number of rows, defaulting to 5.\n",
        "- If we wanted to get an overview of all the dtypes used in our dataframe, along with its shape and some extra information, we could use the [DataFrame.info()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.info.html#pandas.DataFrame.info) method. Note that **DataFrame.info()** prints the information, rather than returning it, so we can't assign it to a variable.\n",

        "You might have noticed that the values in the code segment above look a little bit different.
